# Hello Scala World!

This is a very simple project skeleton for those who want to start experimenting with Scala programming quickly.

If you open the pom.xml as a project in [Intellij Idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and you have the Scala plugin installed, you get support from the ide for syntax highlighting, autocompletion, compiling, running, etc.
